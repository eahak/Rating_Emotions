Live motion rating with video. 

Compiled distribution is over GitHub's max file size. Please request for compiled distribution.

EmoTVRater.app is designed using Max/MSP 8 on Mac OSX. It allows for frame-by-frame recording of rated emotion, and visual feedback using online slider ranging from ‘negative emotion’ (left) to ‘positive emotion’ (right) via ‘neutral emotion’ (centre). The rating is taken to be the horizontal position of the cursor. The output is a .csv file of slider position (from 0 = negative emotion, to 1 = positive emotion) at each frame instance. The participant ID is stored as the first row of the .csv file.
