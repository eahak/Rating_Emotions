EmoTVrater_v2_0_1 README FILE 

Instructions

BEFORE… you may need to enable the ‘open apps from anywhere’ option in Sierra and High Sierra by typing the following into the terminal: sudo spctl --master-disable

You may also need to drag the app out of its folder, and then back in again (to do with gatekeeper path randomization for unsigned apps). 

1. Create test folder that contains the app and the videos.

2. Open the app.

3. Specify video filename e.g. ‘text.mov’.

4. Specify participant ID e.g. ‘1130’.

5. Hit ‘ready’

6. Hit Start - the video will play and the mouse position will be tracked and displayed as the emotion rating. The HORIZONTAL mouse position will be stored with current frame number.

7. When video ends, select save results and specify a filename.

[IMPORTANT: SPECIFY THE FILE EXTENTION .txt or .csv]

8. Text file will contain a header (participant ID) as well as two columns - emotion rating (column 1) and frame number (column 2).


FEATURES:

Spacebar pause/resume
Adaptive playback resolution
